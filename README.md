# Churn_Rate_Codeflix

Four months into launching Codeflix and I've been asked to look into subscription churn rates. Itâ€™s early on in the business with people excited to know how the company is doing.

The marketing department's particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provided a dataset containing subscription data for
users who were acquired through two distinct channels.

The dataset provided contains one SQL table, subscriptions. Within the table, there are 4 columns:

id - the subscription id
subscription_start - the start date of the subscription
subscription_end - the end date of the subscription
segment - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to

Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.
